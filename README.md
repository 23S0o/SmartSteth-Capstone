# SmartSteth-Capstone

Welcome to SmartSteth Repository, which include all the recorded data, source codes, and Instructions for Our Capstone Project "SmartSteth".

A walk through to the available files:

**1. Test.mlapp**
      It's the initial Matlap GUI code that was used in Capstone one to record, display, play, and save the recorded Heart Sounds and Lung Sounds using our stethoscope               Prototype.

**2. SmartSteth.py**
      It's the extened GUI code from Matlab to Python, and was used for the data collection stage since we found our methods of recording the audio had better qualit in python       than Matlab. The GUI is also able to Record, Play, and save the heart sounds and lung sounds into their specific folders;

      **To use it:**
      Make sure to to 
      1. Download all the needed libraries.
      2. Save "SmartSteth.py" in a directory with addition to two files "Heart Sounds Samples" and "Lung Sounds Samples".
